# OSI-Layers-Documentation
This repository provides a foundational explanation of computer networking concepts, focusing on network components and the OSI model, with a practical, real-world perspective.

It covers the roles of essential networking devices such as modems, routers, switches, NICs, and repeaters, explaining how data moves from a local device to the internet. The repository also presents a layer-by-layer walkthrough of the OSI model, demonstrating how a real web request (e.g., opening a website) traverses each layer—from application protocols like HTTP/HTTPS, through TCP/IP, down to Ethernet and physical transmission.

Additionally, the content explains key networking mechanisms including:

DNS resolution

TLS encryption

TCP segmentation

IP routing

ARP and MAC address resolution

Ethernet framing and physical transmission

This material is intended as a learning reference for students and beginners in networking, emphasizing conceptual clarity, protocol roles, and real-life data flow rather than implementation code.
